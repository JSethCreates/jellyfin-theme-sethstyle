**God, Not Another Theme!**  
Originally built with Material Design 3 principles and root color definitions in 2023.  
Redesigned and released with Material 3 Expressive considerations in May 2025.

> **Video Demo Coming Soon**

 
GNAT features a number of quality-of-life changes, with a focus on **media item pages**: prioritizing the **tagline and plot** while de-emphasizing technical data like codecs and stream selections, which are now moved toward the bottom of the page.

GNAT follows MD3 guidelines ‚Äî primary action buttons are **visually distinct**, the **color system is fully swappable**, and **semantic styling** makes the entire layout more cohesive.  
The code is well commented, making it a solid starting point for anyone creating a new theme. All color targets are already mapped and unified.
