**God, Not Another Theme!**  
Originally built with Material Design 3 principles and root color definitions in 2023.  
Redesigned and released with Material 3 Expressive considerations in May 2025.
 
GNAT features a number of quality-of-life changes, with a focus on **media item pages**: prioritizing the **tagline and plot** while de-emphasizing technical data like codecs and stream selections, which are now moved toward the bottom of the page.

GNAT follows MD3 guidelines ‚Äî primary action buttons are **visually distinct**, the **color system is fully swappable**, and **semantic styling** makes the entire layout more cohesive.  
The code is well commented, making it a solid starting point for anyone creating a new theme. All color targets are already mapped and unified.

## Installation

Paste the following into your Jellyfin dashboard:  
**Admin > Dashboard > General > Custom CSS**

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JSethCreates/jellyfin-theme-sethstyle@v1.0.0/sethstyle.css");
```

This theme was designed for use as a lean-back interface for JFWeb on a TV or Android-box, with remote control, at 1080p+.  
At resolutions < 1000 pixels wide, this theme will revert to standard JFWeb, with nominal color changes.
