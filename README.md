**God, Not Another Theme!**  
Originally built with Material Design 3 principles and root color definitions in 2023.  
Redesigned and released with Material 3 Expressive considerations in May 2025 for jellyfin v10.10.x.
 
GNAT features a number of quality-of-life changes, with a focus on media item pages: -Fixing the primary action panel, and flex-wraping secondary info containers,
-Prioritizing the cinematic elements (logo, tagline, plot, cast) while shifting more technical buckets like codecs and stream selections lower on the page.
-Custom slider thumb designs on WebKit/Firefox, fixed-position progress bar to prevent bouncing, OSD time text styling and placement
-Replacing header Text-button tabs with Material Icons (or Emoji example coded)

GNAT follows MD3 guidelines -primary action buttons are **visually distinct**, the **color system is fully swappable**, and **semantic styling** makes the entire layout more cohesive.
-MD3 Subtle growth, shadow, and background color transitions, Rounded corners everywhere, Typography & Headings unified, -Styles buttons, FABs, progress indicators, list-item hovers, 
checkboxes, sliders, spinners, and card placeholders all styled within the 9 color MD3 palette, including hover/focus tints and mix-in backgrounds. 

I tried to make it a solid starting point for anyone creating a new theme. All color targets are already mapped and unified in the initial sections of the CSS.
